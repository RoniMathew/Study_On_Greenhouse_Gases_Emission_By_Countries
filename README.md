This study delves into the critical issue of greenhouse gas emissions 
by countries, investigating their role in climate change and global 
warming. The research involves a comprehensive analysis of 
greenhouse gas data sourced from 15 countries worldwide, spanning a 
decade from 2007 to 2016. Through the examination of this extensive 
dataset, the study aims to identify and understand the patterns and 
trends associated with greenhouse gas emissions. An interactive
